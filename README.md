# r/Redirect

[![Build Status](https://gitlab.com/Elypia/r-slash-redirect/badges/main/pipeline.svg)](https://gitlab.com/Elypia/r-slash-redirect/commits/main)

## About

An add-on for browsers to redirect `r/…` from the URL bar or search engines to the respective subreddit.

* Override searches for `r/…` in popular search engines to redirect immediately to the respective subreddit.
* Registers a search keyword, so that when you type `r/ `, you search with the r/Redirect add-on which takes you to the respective subreddit.

## LibRedirect

This add-on pairs well with [LibRedirect](https://libredirect.github.io/). If you install LibRedirect and enable Reddit redirection, you'll be redirected to your preferred privacy-friendly Reddit frontend like [Libreddit](https://github.com/libreddit/libreddit).

## Alternatives

You can instead use DuckDuckGo as your default search engine. DuckDuckGo features [Bangs](https://duckduckgo.com/bangs) which can achieve a similar result, no add-on required.

1. Set DuckDuckGo as your [default search engine](https://duckduckgo.com/set-as-default).
2. In the URL bar or DuckDuckGo search page, use the `sr` bang, short for **s**ub**r**eddit. Searches like `!sr …` will perform the same behavior as this extension.
